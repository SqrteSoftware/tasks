# Contributing

To help make sure time is not wasted and a contribution is accepted, please follow these steps:

1) Before coding anything, create a quick Sqrte Tasks Enhancement Proposal (STEP) via a github issue.
    - Describe what you would like to do
    - Describe a rough design
    - Keep it short and simple. Details can be sorted out via conversation as needed.
2) Once the STEP is agreed upon, go ahead and implement the changes in your fork.
3) Create a Pull Request to be reviewed.

You can, of course, create a PR first thing if you prefer, but it may not be accepted. These steps are to help make sure everyone is in agreement with a change and will hopefully save time for everyone by preventing surprises.
